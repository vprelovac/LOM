This area, my second, is dedicated to Becky Boilek, who gives me the inspir-
 ation to write these things.  Who gives me the inspiration for EVERYTHING.
                               Thank you, Becky.
 
Oh yeah, and by the way, the Art Gallery was based, in part (a small part) on
Owzer's house, in Final Fantasy III.  Those who've played it know what I mean.
