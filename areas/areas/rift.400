A Windswept Ledge~
The moment you materialize on this ledge you are almost swept off it
by a strong gust of icy wind, that almost sends you hurtling down the
sheer slope of the mountain that this tiny section of level stone is
set into. A yawning abyss beckons there, you cannot even see to the
bottom through the blizzard that is raging through the region. Other
snow-covered spires loom all around, while gale force winds buffet you
mercilessly. The wind howls and shrieks as it blows through the gaps
between the peaks; the effect is quite disturbing. The only apparent
escape from this torment is a small hole in the ground, that leads on
down into the darkness within the mountain.

A Dark Passage~
A tunnel descends steeply from the ledge, heading down to whatever is
within the bowels of the peak you arrived on. No torches light the
area, at least not here, though a dim light is visible far, far below.
Snow drifts formed by snow that has come in the hole above pile high to
either side, and are marked with the tracks of various creatures, some
of whom are rather large; giantish in fact. The howling wind above is
nerve wracking, and it takes little incentive to proceed downwards to
where it is quieter.

A Divided Tunnel~
At this point the tunnel splits, with two branches heading further down
into the depths of the mountain, though at a noticeably flatter gradient;
gone is the steep descent you have up till now endured. A dim glow can 
be seen to the southeast, where the majority of the tracks seem to pass
to and from. The walls are of crevice-ridden granite, covered with thin
layers of ice and frost, frozen by the chilly temperatures here, though
they are at least bearable with adequate clothing, unlike outside.

The Rift~
After roughly one hundred yards, the path emerges onto another ledge,
though this one is inside instead of outside. To your surprise, it
runs for a short distance along the eastern edge of a truly massive
rift, which yawns to the west, stretching into the distance to the far
south. Gusts of wind whistle up and down the rift, the floor of which
is not visible from this vantage. The ledge continues to the south,
disappearing around a bend to the southwest, as it circles the rift.
An opening in the wall just south of here offers an alternate route,
however, and it is to here that most of the tracks run.

An Opening in the Rift Wall~
The ledge continues its course along the eastern rim of the rift,
narrowing a little as it nears a bend to the southwest. An opening in
the eastern wall looms up ahead, opening onto a darkened tunnel that
heads away from the rift, towards whatever else lies down here. A
faint greenish glow provides a little light here and there, though the
conditions are still gloomy, to your eyes at least.

A Junction~
Two passages lead away from this narrow accessway, which ends in a dead
end a short distance to the north of here. The floor underfoot is slick,
though not dangerously so, at least not yet. The walls are covered in 
ice, which has been worn away in portions due to contact with the bodies
of passing creatures, who where apparently of considerable stature. The
faint greenish glow is still present, illuminating fresh tracks in the
thin layer of powdery snow that layers the floor at random intervals.

An Icy Cave~
Several piles of sleeping skins cover the floor of this cave, which
is for the most part covered in layers of ice, save for where the
sleeping area is. Piles of boulders and blocks of ice lay near the
entrance, presumably to serve as primitive missile weapons for the
monsters that lair here, who are undoubtedly sentient, and more than
likely of malevolent mein. No other exit umbrages the icy walls; the
cave is isolated from the rest of the complex save for the opening
to the north.

An Icy Cavern~
This natural cavern was hollowed out by centuries of erosion from the
movement of ice through the bowels of the mountain, and as such could
escape notice as being the residence of giants, save for the four fur
covered mounds that serve as their beds. Large icy stalactites depend
from the high roof; excessive heat or noise could bring them tumbling
down, so caution would be advised. A broad passage, leading further 
into the icy home of the frost giants, can be detected to the east.

An Icy Passage~
This broad passage runs east for a short distance, before turning to
the south, heading directly towards the center of the mountain, and
running parallel to the rift to the west, beyond the guard rooms. It
appears that this passage sees frequent usage; fresh footprints mark
small patches of snow, while several of the icy protrusions have also
been snapped off as clumsy giants stumble into them, especially when
they are intoxicated.

An Icy Passage~
The passage continues, stretching into the distance as far as one can
see under the current lighting conditions. The air is cold, though 
not unbearably so, and the walls covered with ice, some of which has
melted and formed dangerous semi-frozen puddles on the floor in the
numerous potholes that mar the tunnel. A larger creature, such as a
giant or troll, may well stumble and fall upon these hazards, though
the injury would do more damage to their pride than their rears.

An Icy Passage~
Onwards and downwards the passage runs, continuing deeper into this
haven of giants. The footprints are just as frequent, and just as
fresh; it appears dozens of giants have been on the move recently.
This is no surprise; you are here because of their 'movements' that
have taken them into conflict with the peaceful races of the south.
The frost giants are a violent and bloodthirsty lot, far tougher and
braver than their brutish hill giant cousins.

An Icy Passage~
At this point the passage begins to bend to the southwest, changing its
course for the first time in several hundred yards. An opening in the
west wall is the first side passage the tunnel has boasted for nearly
its entire length, though judging by the tracks it is not a popular
section of the rift. Your sense of direction tells you that heading 
around the bend to the west will take you back out towards the ledges
that line the rift, though there appears to be little choice but to
return and skirt that ominous feature.

The tunnel narrows slighty here, as it bends, though only a score of
giants would notice any inconvenience. To the west, it narrows to an
opening back onto the sections of ledge that line the great rift at
random intervals, while to the northeast it winds around a bend and
heads back north towards the entrance to this monstrous subterranean
lair. Stomping and shouting echo all about, as giants make their way
through their glacial home.

This small cavern is filled at periodic intervals with all manner of
supplies for the giant raiding parties before they set out to do 
harm to humanity. Currently, it is almost empty, a sure sign that in
fact such a raid is taking place right now. Deep marks in the ice on
the floor show where heavy barrels and casks once rested.

The ledge hugs the rift wall here, allowing scant purchase for anyone
to travel; at times you have to hug the wall as well, grabbing what
handholds you can to avoid being swept off the icy ledge, which affords
precious little purchase, by the winds that gust through the rift. A
lone wolf howls somewhere in the distance; a warning, perhaps, or a cry
of distress?

The ledge ends here, at a rubble strewn ledge that boasts a broad
cave entrance to the east, within which lies the gods-know-what... 
it is far too dark to see far, despite the greenish glow given off
at sporadic intervals by the unusual lithic anomalies that are so
common in this subterranean rift. Tracks in the thin layer of snow
that carpets the rubble appear to be canine, or more accurately,
lupine in origin.

An Icy Cave~
This gloomy cavern does not contain the luminescent stone found in 
other sections of the caves, and thus it is quite difficult to see
and navigate. Large chunks of ice litter the floor, having fallen 
from the roof above; apparently the ceiling of icicles is extremely 
unstable. Dark openings beckon to the east and south; the wolf tracks
pass to and from the opening to the east.

Wolf Pack~
This small cave is devoid of rubble; instead it boasts piles of frozen
corpses, in various stages of consumption, and piles of bones, covered
in bite marks. Whatever beast tore these people apart, it must have a
set of powerful jaws. An awful smell, of wet canine, permeates all of
this cave, insulting your nostrils with its stench.

A Burial Chamber, of Sorts~
Several hacked and mutilated bodies have been frozen upright into the
icy walls of this chamber, to intimidate intruders, as these are the
remains of previous trespassers, displaying the fate they met. Many 
of them still appear to be wearing their equipment; perhaps some of
it is still in reasonable condition. The corpses are of elves, dwarves
and humans, doubtless previous adventurers who sought to put down the
leadership that has inspired the giants to war against humanity. Most of
them were slain by blows to the head, then savaged by wolves, or perhaps
even trolls. Frozen blood still carpets most of their forms, which stand
with mouths agape, captured in the shock of death.

An Icy Ledge~
The tunnel opens onto another icy ledge, this one marginally wider
than the one near the entrance to the north, which is dimly visible
from here, bending sharply away to the northeast some 300 feet away,
in between lying one of the deep gorges opening into the rift, which
runs north and south parallel to the ledge as far as you can see. A
fierce wind whistles eerily through the rift, chilling you even in
your warm clothing. The floor of the rift is some 200 feet below, a
fall that would kill the stoutest of men; flying down is also out of
the question as the fierce winds would smash you against the rift wall.

The ledge ends abruptly just south of here, the only choice of route
to proceed being another opening in the eastern wall. The wind howls
and screams, while flecks of snow from a blizzard raging in the very
center of the rift strike you in the face. Visibility is poor; you 
are effectively snowblinded, able to see only a short distance by the
aid of the greenish glow that suffuses this place.

A Junction~
Several passages branch off into the icy depths of the caverns that
surround the glacial rift, most of them heading to the south, and 
thus deeper into the complex maze of passages. It is south that you
must go, for it is there that you will surely encounter the Jarl, but
the possibility of gathering loot from those along the way should not
be ignored either. Numerous giants can be seen moving about in the
distance, though a careful adventurer shouldn't find them terribly hard
to avoid.

Heaps of furry hides cover the floor of this cavern, which is not lit
by the greenish glow so common in most of the rift. Instead, the walls
are a dull grey, visible through the thin translucent layer of frost
that coats them. This cavern is the quarters for some of the many non-

quality of their bedding, which could best be described as inadequate.

The bedding here is little better than that to the north, and the same

smell, of unwashed ogre combined with excrement and stale food, is
noticeable from even a dozen yards away. How a creature could live like
this is beyond you, though the chill does mean that the spoiled food and
waste is usually frozen before disease afflicts the occupants, who seem

This corridor is knee-deep in snow, that has blown in from the west,
where it opens onto an icy ledge that overlooks the blizzard-ridden
glacial rift. No tracks mar the white powder, as it slowly turns to
slush; it would appear the giants have no need, or desire, to travel
down this section of their lair. It is cold here, colder even than

This section of the ledges that surround in part the glacial rift is
the most exposed to the raging blizzard that continually assaults the

speed, which threaten to send you sailing off the icy ledge to the icy
ground far, far below. Even if the fall didn't kill you, the howling
wind would most likely dash you against the rocks long before you did
in fact impact with the ground.

As you pass into the cave, you are engulfed in mist, and find it hard

beneath your feet! The hidden heat source has melted the icy floor of
the cave, exposing a gaping hole that plummets many scores of yards
downwards through the center of the mountain, and it is down this hole
you plummet; even a fly spell couldn't save you as strong currents of
wind grab ahold of you and dash you against jagged protrusions as you
fall. You are dead long before your battered form is impaled on the 
sharp icicles that line the bottom of this gorge, where it will remain,
undiscovered for, most likely, all eternity.

difficult to maintain your position on the icy ground. Flight more than

This cave quarters the representatives of the hill giants, who keep
the Jarl informed of the progress of their people, and keep Nosnra 
equally informed of the Jarl's plans, as ordained by Snurre of the
fire giants, the leaders of the alliance. However, this has changed
recently with the destruction of the Steading at the hands of mighty
adventurers, and now the hill giants have the unenviable task here
of informing the Jarl of this occurence. The Jarl has a reputation 
for blaming the bearer of ill tidings, and these three know for sure
that their heads will soon decorate the Jarl's trophy room.

lit and the occupants alert. More voices echo on either side, from 
groups of giants heading to or from duty. Bloodstains mark the snow
next to two drag marks where dinner was dragged along earlier.

A Bend in the Tunnel~
The wind howls and shrieks at regular intervals to the northeast, though
at this distance down the tunnel you are safe from the brunt of it. But
despite the distance, snow drifts have still managed to form, piling in
the corners to chest height on a giant. Booted feet have trampled down
the snow nearest the center of the passage. The air is chill, more than
usual, and you feel you are approaching the lower levels.

An Unexpected Sensation~
At this point in the corridor you are assaulted by a blast of heat,
totally unexpected in this icy domain. The tracks in the snow skirt
wide of its source- a large opening in the southeastern wall. A dim
reddish glow, like that of embers, is visible, and the heat has all
but melted the ice in the vicinity, leaving bare the rock underneath.
Evidently this chamber has been customised to suit the needs of some
visitors.

The Fire Giant Embassy~
Plumes of flame leap forth from hidden openings in the rock, flickering
and dancing as their source- natural gas- fluctuates in the pressure it
comes out with. The entire cavern is devoid of ice; instead it contains
some unusual (for a frost giant lair) furniture of obsidian- a table, a
chair and several benches, plus several braziers stacked with burning
coals. If the cold is so unpleasant for one of your race, you cannot

The End of the Tunnel~
The tunnel ends abruptly here, where it meets another running in a
perpindicular course to it. Tracks are heavy in the thin layer of ice
and snow underfoot, most of them heading east, where the passage slopes
downward, towards a new level of the rift. The corridor is more even 
and better illuminated than the upper ones; torches set in cressets on
the smooth stone walls light the way.

The passage slopes downward to the east, a gentle but definite angle

creatures moving about on business of their own, most of them giants.
Other races are pretty much restricted to quarters, save for several
wolves, that roam the tunnels in search of magically concealed foes.

The icy layer is thinner here than earlier, and no longer forms the
bulk of the architecture. Thus it is safe for the giants to place some
torches here, set in cressets on the walls, to cast ample light to see
by, without fear of the tunnel collapsing. Howls and shrieks, from one
of several monsters rather than the wind for a change, echo all around
you.

exists in this direction- no giants can be seen or heard moving in

of smooth, though unworked, stone, which bear small tapestries and a
torch or three. The hard stony ground underfoot cannot betray signs of
passage, though the stone worn smooth along the walls by encounters 
with giantish shoulders show that some creatures do frequent this area.
Although there are no markings or indicators, you feel certain that you
are nearing the Jarl's own chambers, or at least his palace.

The passage exits into a high, open cavern, that stretches away in all
three directions. The starry sky is visible far, far above, over 300
yards away; the effect is quite enthralling. The cavern is eerily quiet
save for the sound of water dripping onto stone somewhere far away. A
grim sense of foreboding comes over you as you consider your options; 
there is a definite evil at work somewhere here, its source not obvious
immediately, but definitely present. Large boulders block two passages
to the east and west, movable only by a stout warrior, while the cavern
continues to the south.

A Vaulted Cavern~
The boulder opens onto a chamber of breathtaking beauty. Instead of
rocky, unhewn walls, this cavern is actually a chamber proper; the 
stone has been carefully worked into a series of doric columns, that
support a vaulted roof heavily decorated with art that appears elvish
in origin, though it is unlike any you have ever seen. Evidently this
place was fashioned by creatures centuries older than the giants, and
abandoned some time ago. The floor is of polished marble, its lustre
adding a glorious shine as your light reflects off of it and onto all
the jewelled statues that ring the hall. It continues to the northeast,
the floor raising slightly to match the terrain. A legion of dwarves
would take decades to match this marvel; even stone giants would be left
gasping in awe at the work that went into bending the natural stone to
the will of the master artisans.

Mistress of the Wyrm~
The floor rises here, to a set of marble steps that, flanked by columns
carved to resemble vase-bearing maidens, rise to a ledge lined with many
statues of bronze, surprisingly free of corrosion, surrounding a dais,
upon which the Queen of this ancient race once reclined. A different kind
of queen now resides here, though she has similar vanities and taste in
furnishings. A jewelled box filled with priceless metals has been almost
casually crushed beneath the weight of an apparently worthless alabaster
statue that would require 6 people to shift. A priceless tapestry has
been sliced to ribbons to bind together a frail, and unappealing, wooden
carving of a giant. Whatever creatures are now masters of this domain,
they have curious values.

Jarl has poor taste in decor, if the tacky tapestries that line the
walls here are any indication; they are cheaply made, and of poor
quality and worksmanship. A long bronze horn, to be winded by the  
guards in emergencies, hangs between two of these insulting works

considering whether to commit their forces to the Jarl's cause. They
have been bribed with numerous gifts and many promises, which they of
course place little stock in. Ogre Magi, unlike regular ogres or even
giants, are highly intelligent and cunning, and recognize a situation

This small cavern houses a single giant- a cloud giant from the far

been convinced that the Jarl has a very good chance of making a tidy
sum of money from his raids, and has signed on as a mercenary. Other
giants, not as easily impressed by the Jarl's speeches, have declined
an alliance, and returned home; many of the cloud giants have stayed
here, and subsequently left in disgust- not all cloud giants are evil.
A table laden with food and fine cutlery are just some of the cajolery
employed by the cunning frost giant lord.

It is apparent that the frost giants have lived and labored in the
caves surrounding the dark rift for centuries, slowly bending the

system of caves to house their people. It would be an admirable feat
were it not achieved by a vile, cruel race using slave labor without

(boars, bears, snakes and birds) to the exotic (wyverns, dragons, sabre
tooth tigers and even a shedu). Arms and armor taken from foes from many
parts of the world are also present, each bearing the scars from blows of
the Jarl that were the end of their former owners. A lynx pelt hangs over
an exit in the eastern wall, where presumably the Jarl rests, while a hide
of a giant lizard flanked by a pair of eagle's wings hang above the exit

of ale and goblets of wine is ample evidence of the tastes these two
have for alcohol, and the fine foods from a dozen different cultures
is a result of the many raids made by the Jarl; he has developed a
taste for foreign cuisine. Several boxes and chests stuffed with a
range of worthless clothing and similar line the walls.

combat and pillaging to talking and creating, and this is evident in

a cave entrance, with the hope of luring prey. It will leap upon any

Taken from the back of an ice wyrm, this hide offers significant benefit
in the form of resistance to cold, which is the bane of fire giants of
all types. Thus it is highly prized by its former owner for these qualities.

bronze shield~
Inlaid with runes by the Magi-Priests of Ebberggehw, this device bestows
great mystical, but little physical, power upon those of the right mind
set to bear it. As the Magi-Priests prefer neutrality, it is prohibited
to those of lawful or good mein, though evil beings can more easily fool
the device into missing the motives hidden in their dark hearts.
