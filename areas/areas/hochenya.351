The Village of Hochenyana~
As you cross the bridge and enter Hochenyana, you are immediately struck
by the lack of activity in the traditionally bustling village. Certainly
there are citizens about, walking slowly up and down the clean streets, but
there is a jerkiness about their movements, and a dazed expression in their
glazed eyes. Even the wildlife seems wistless and dull. Something is amiss 
here, by Anagar, and you determine to find out what!

Main Street~
You pass into Hochenyana, and arrive at Main Street, the quadrangle
of avenues off of which all of the principal businesses and residences
of the thriving community rest. Normally the street would be abuzz with
activity, but today you see only a few emaciated townsfolk, staggering in
a daze up and down the street. Turning to greet some of them, you are taken
aback when they utterly ignore you.

Main Street ~
Main Street runs west here, past several shops and houses. The street
is clean, and free of any debris or even a cracked cobblestone. Everything
seems to be in order, except for the zombie like villagers of course. A
foul smell wafts in from the north, while to the south you can hear someone
singing.

The Butchery~
A nauseating smell, one of dead meat left to rot, assaults your nostrils
as you enter, almost (but not quite) distracting you from the horrid
spectacle of dozens of mutilated corpses littering the bloodstained floor
and shop counter. The walls drip with gore and blood; even the ceiling has
been splattered with the stuff. You feel fairly certain that this is not
a healthy place to be...

A General Store~
The shelves in this little shop are filled, but as you peer closer you
notice that the items that fill them are rubbish, odds and ends no one would
ever want to buy. Confused, you wonder who in hades would be able to prosper
with such a business? Odd business is afoot in Hochenyana, to be sure.

Main Street~
You have reached a corner of the rectangular street of Hochenyana, where
it heads east and south. Shops and houses line each direction, though there
is little evidence of activity in them. Several lie nearby, their doors open
or missing entirely...
 
A weatherbeaten sign hangs over a small business to the west, marking it as
an inn or tavern of some sort.

Animal Attack~
The furniture in this dwelling has been smashed to flinders, the blood
stained remains a testament to the strength and ferocity of whatever
slew the hapless townsfolk who once resided here. The smell of rotting
meat is strong here, as is the fecund odor of a wild animal. Little
of use seems to have survived the assault.

The Laughing Eagle~
The interior of this town pub has been recently swept clean, and the 
tables are all neatly arranged and free from empty mugs, plates of
half eaten food or the like. The entire place is fresh and clear of any
mess; in other words it's damned unusual for a pub... The patrons just
sit at the tables, reacting to little. The proprieter stands behind the
bar, absently wiping the counter top repeatedly, heedless of what he is
doing.

Main Street~
Main street runs south here, past several neatly manicured gardens and
more spacious, comfortable dwellings, while to the north it bends 
eastward, heading towards the entrance to the town. You notice a dog,
sitting listlessly in the gutter, ignoring your attempts to provoke him
into playing with stick or ball. The air here is still, and the ambient
noise level is contributed to only by you or the noise of shuffling
villagers' feet.

Potrax's Potions~
This is a well appointed alchemist's shop; the shelves are overburdened
with all manner of elixirs, potions, flasks and philters. Essential oils
fill jars and containers near the counter, upon which a smoky oil lamp
casts a smoky luminescence. Heaven to mages, the aroma and surrounds tend
to make others feel rather claustrophobic and uncomfortable.

An Empty House~
This comfortable little dwelling boasts several plush easy chairs, a
small table covered in trinkets, a cupboard stacked with all manner of
cups and saucers, and a hearth, which has been packed for a cheery blaze.
There is no sign of any occupants, however, nor does anyone come running
when you yell out. Shrugging, you settle down in one of the chairs to 
rest for a short while.

Main Street~
Main Street bends here again, branching to the north and east, past
yet more houses and shops. The monotony of the lifeless townsfolk and
the empty houses is beginning to tell on you; it is with a heavy heart
that you continue into the depressing place. Nary a smile or a wave from
any of the cheerless folk; something terrible is indeed amiss...

An Abandoned Smithy~
Where once there was a fine smithy, a place of the purchasing and 
repairing of items of war, now there is only a cold forge, some rusted
tools and a couple of suits of shoddy armor. Bloodstains carpet the 
straw floor, and the walls bear deep gouges, as if a terrific battle
took place here.

The Stables~
The poor beasts that were stabled here have not been fed in months, and
abandoned thusly they slowly died of starvation. A foul occurence, and
undoubtedly will result in the lingering of some malevolent manifestation
of misfortune and doom. The rancid air carries the stench of death, as
well as something more sinister.

Main Street~
Main Street runs east and west here, past more deserted dwellings and
shops fallen into states of disrepair and ruination. A lingering stench
of decaying foodstuffs wafts in from the north, while to the south you
can hear someone gibbering, in fear or madness, or both.

The Ruined Fruit Stand~
Piles of rotting fruit and vegetables are piled waist high in moldering
sacks and broken wooden crates, creating the sickly sweet aroma of 
decay you detected earlier. No one is present here; perhaps the sight and
smell of such decay was too much even for the ensorcelled townsfolk.

An Abandoned Tenement~
Smashed furniture covered in dust and cobwebs litters the floor of this
house, accompanied by bloodstains and scraps of cloth. It would appear that
not all of the residents of Hochenyana succumbed easily to the evil sorcery
worked upon this place, and paid for their willpower with their lives. The
senselessness of all of this angers you; when will it stop?

A Junction~
Here, Main Street is met by another street, Heroes' Walk, which runs
south towards some larger structures in the town. Named for the annual
march which used to traditionally take place here to celebrate the
defeat of the Chaos Hordes at this point by the townsfolk, it has not
seen such a parade in some time.

Main Street~
You advance cautiously along this stretch of Main Street, wary of the
eerie silence of the town, and the shuffling zombie like citizens who
occasionally pass soundlessly by. Something is amiss here, be it malady
or curse. Shops to the north and south boast little signs of trade;
no one seems interested in anything here.

Edmund's Armory~
Someone or something large has recently given this shop the once-over,
taking anything of value and smashing the rest to flinders. Fist marks
the size of your torso scar the stone walls, while the floor is stained
with blood, some of it fresh. A pile of smoldering rags in one corner
marks the point where an oil lamp fell and shattered during the fracas,
igniting a pile of cleaning cloths.

The Footman's Pike~
This weaponsmith has been thoroughly looted and trashed, whatever force
that did it taking advantage of the poor mental state of the townsfolk and
the absence of any obvious security. Broken and smashed weapons of all 
sorts litter the bloodsoaked floor, along with several corpses of giant
rats, goblins and even a large toad. What odd findings in a suburban
residental area!

Main Street~
Main Street ends at a corner here, where it bends sharply to the west
and south, the two roads meeting at right angles forming one corner
of the quadrangle street that most of Hochenyana depends on. Piles of
debris are all about here, in stark contrast to the clean swept street
west of here. It is as if someone or something had swept all of the rubbish
into this one section of road.

The Flawed Diamond~
Once a propserous jewellery store, this empty building now only contains
smashed and broken cases, the valuable gemstones long since stolen by
many rampagers and monsters. With no one to defend them, they were easy
pickings. The jeweller himself remains oblivious to all of this, seeming
intent only on how awful the weather is...

This abandoned tenement shows signs of a recent battle, blood stains
and broken weapons littering the dirty floor. A couple of decaying

The roof of this house has collapsed, allowing the elements to wreak
havoc on the interior. Waterlogged furniture sits in a knee deep pool
of dirty water covered in insect larvae, and you begin to feel

Normally this broad tree-lined thoroughfare would be abuzz with activity;
the townsfolk rushing to and fro on various errands. But now nary a soul
stirs, and those that do seem to be in a deep trance, from which even harsh
words and strong blows cannot awaken them. The buildings to either side 
appear to be ones of importance, especially the residence of the Mayor to
the southwest of here. To the southeast, a large white tower rises from the
huddle of dwellings.

tower and the mayor's house, respectively. Few townsfolk can be seen here,
and there is no sign of any sort of guard near either residence. To the
south Heroes' Walk continues towards the Temple of Asteh, deity of this
town.

The side road ends before a sturdy oak door that marks the entrance to

a tiled roof. Expensive in construction, its design signifies the importance
of its resident, as well as marks him as a man of power and respect. It

this fine town. A thick rug covers most of the floor, and a neat
doormat has been discreetly positioned near the entrance to allow visitors
to clean their boots and save the quality of the doubtlessly expensive
rug. The ceiling is supported by thick exposed beams of oak, from which
chandeliers depend, affixed to sturdy iron chains as thick as your forearm.

piles of official documents, but from here it looks as if most of them are
either blank or covered in meaningless scribbles. A plush chair rests behind
the desk, for the convenience of the Mayor's secretary, as does a large
lantern, which burns continuously, the result of a minor but strong dweomer.
A stout wooden door to the west leads into the Mayor's office.

shelves of heavy books and trophies, including some fine hunting trophies;
the head of a massive stag hangs above the polished wooden desk that is
the Mayor's. A narrow staircase heads up to the second level, and whatever
is contained there; most likely the private rooms of the Mayor.

and boasts no windows or other visible entrances; simply sheer walls of
white marble.

The first notion that strikes you as you enter the tower is that whoever
originally constructed it would not have intended it to be in the state it
is now. Smashed furniture and shredded books cover the grimy floor, and
piles of mangled tapestries have been built into large nests for a variety
of vermin. The stench is unbearable, and unmistakably goblin. Your hatred
for these savage brutes grows as you continue through the carnage. To the
east, a stone staircase continues to the next level, while to the south
a long corridor heads to other chambers.

Two long tables crammed with a variety of alchemical equipment line
the walls, while a small cot has been sandwiched in between tall shelves
overburdened with books to the north. Some of these books have been scattered
on the floor in disgust by the shaman, who was not intelligent enough to

Hochenyana. Long wings of stone lead off of the main structure, which is
a large hemispherical marble building, supported by thick doric columns
spaced evenly about the perimeter. Elegant murals cover the walls within
these pillars, which protect the interior from the elements, though the
orginial architects protested, intending to have the central worship area
exposed, as a deity of the winds and air would wish. However, common sense
and the typically wet Estroglian weather prevailed.

Nary a whisper can be heard as you pass into the vaulted halls of

enchantment is in place, cast here by the clerics of old to subdue 
boisterous worshippers as they entered. You must admit one soon loses
the desire to be noisy when one cannot hear the result! The walls are
bare here, starkly white with faint traces of silvery runes, which mark
two barely visible doors to the east and west. To the south lies the

concentrated here is beyond quanitifiable measure; you have no doubt that, if

Algebra to Zoology, line the walls, restricting your vision to the point where
it is hard to truly appreciate the size of the library. You can hear other

The Librarian's Office~
This small office is cluttered with shelves full of books awaiting
cataloguing and/or reshelving, and since the strange events that started
recently in the town these tasks have remained unfinished. There is no
sign of the head librarian, or any librarians for that matter, which is
indeed strange.

Before the Altar~
A shimmering field of black energy suffuses this section of the temple,
its source the new towering black monolith that serves an altar to the
vile demon No'ol and also suffices in a role as a sacrifical table. You
feel ill at ease here, and realize that the magical forces here will make
escape difficult from whatever may lie ahead, behind the massive bloodsoaked
altar. You dodge around mangled corpses dangling from barbed hooks attached
to long rusted metal chains depending from the arched ceiling, which has been
blackened by fire.

The Gaping Pit~
Here, an evil block of black stone rises from a gaping hole in the 
earth, which leads into some netherworld from which the vile beast that
conducts operations here was spawned. To enter it would mean no return,
and you are certain that not even you could survive long when exposed to
the pure chaos that surely lurks at the bottom of this void. A shrill shrieking
emanates from all sides; its source hundreds of faces that press against the
walls, as if they belonged to people imprisoned within the shifting surface of
the stone. You had heard that all structures of Chaos were formed from the 
unwilling souls of sacrifical victims, bound to eternal excruciating pain as
building blocks for Chaos.

A Gruesome Death~
As you descend into the sacrificial pit that has been gouged into the
temple, thousands of pairs of scabby, claws arms reach out and grab at
you, dragging you down into the inky blackness of the bottomless pit,
and subjecting you to thousands of interesting new sensations of pain
as they slowly slay and devour you...

A Shadowy Corridor~
This corridor extends southwards towards two doors set at the end.
There is little evidence of goblin occupation in this place; indeed
it doesn't appear that they have ventured very far at all down this
passageway, as goblins have a habit of making it rather obvious with
their debris where they have been.

A Shadowy Corridor~
Presently you find the reason for the conspicuous absence of the goblins;
a massive pedestal rests here, upon which stands a guardian, placed here
by the mage some time ago to guard his most treasured possessions. It
has unfortunately been away from the guidance of its creator for too long,
however, and now berserkly attacks anything that enters here, which thus
far has only been many goblins, the corpses of which litter the floor.

The Arsenel~
The mage constructed this chamber to bear an impressive array of
magical devices he one day hoped to acquire; unfortunately for any
avaricious visitors his collection thus far is rather small. Two plain
benches support long metal crates, which the mage planned to fill with
his items. Perhaps, however, there are one or two lying around...

Two Doors~
The corridor ends here, before two plain metal doors, bearing no

not to mention a hindrance should he need to frequent these chambers.
Runes are carved into each door, denoting its purpose and contents.

The mage used this chamber to house a rather irascible elemental he

These powerfully built creatures are feared foes of any subterranean

habitat is bad for two reasons; one, it means all regular methods of
monster control have collapsed, making this a perilous place indeed to
be. And secondly, umber hulks are usually found outside of their lairs
only as lackeys of more powerful evil creatures such as Illithids and
Beholders. And if either of those fell creatures is about you could be
in serious trouble indeed...

the mayor's secretary~
A plump, middle aged woman sits here behind a huge desk.

This woman appears to be unusually bright and cheerful, for this place;
you wonder for a second if she somehow resisted the malediction plaguing
her peers, then you notice that her smile is forced, her eyes emotionless,
and realize it is almost as if she is just acting out a preprogrammed 
series of activities and responses.

A heavy-set, bearded man sits on a chair, fuming.

Geoffrey Hiln, veteran of countless battles against Chaos, is by
repute a loud spoken bear of a man, who is just as likely to deck
someone who insults him as try to talk them down. He is abrupt, curt
and rude, but loved and respected by his villagers, whom he would give
his life to protect. His imprisonment has done little to dull his senses,
or his temper.

an avatar of Asteh~
A glowing humanoid stands trapped behind a shimmering force field.

The avatar was summoned during the taking of the temple by the clergy
in a last ditch effort to save their church. However the avatar was
overcome and entrapped here, where the faithful of No'ol can scorn and
deride it. The force field bars only it from moving; all others may pass
freely. Her armor bears many dents, and her skin is burned badly in several
places, punishment from her captors.

This foul creature of evil is the ringleader of the evil influence that

power, Xyrtog is also a highly influential force in the Beholder City
of Qu'gphtek M'gyhr. With his illithid allies, he intends to expand
the range of his ensorcellment, and achieve what chaos has failed to
do for centuries, and without even having to spill a drop of blood, though
that does not worry the evil tyrant.
