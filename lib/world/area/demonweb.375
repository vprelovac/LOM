Floating Through Chaos~
Floating, falling, with nothing to break the bleak void, nothing to
focus on to alleviate the nausea hurtling through nothingness is
causing. After a while, your fall begins to slow in velocity, and you
see a tiny pinprick of light in the void, rapidly growing larger as
you near it. Eventually you land with a soft bump on what appears to
be a plain stone platform, the only feature in this realm of pure
nothingness, your only bearing (and a welcome one it is!). The light
is apparently a portal, of sorts, opening onto, to your surprise, a
rather plain stone corridor...

Den of Offal~
Piles of rotting, rancid garbage, of assorted and foul origin, catches

closely you half-imagine you can see something moving about in the
refuse; surely not?

The Stronghold of Trose~
This small chamber boasts a simple cot bed, a pile of broken furniture
and several holy symbols, nailed to the bare walls. A large cage fills
the eastern section of the room, and within it you can see several
feeble humans, crawling weakly about and begging for mercy. A foul,
but bearable, odor emanates from these wretches, and also from the rather
dishevelled and unwashed individual who inhabits this cubicle.

Cage of Chaos~
Stained straw is scattered across the broken, uneven stone floor of
this cell, which serves as home to those unfortunates imprisoned 
within the sturdy iron bars. The air is rich with the unpleasant and
pervasive aroma of sweat, urine and faeces, and is almost (but not
quite) as unpleasant as a troll warren.

A Barracks ~
This long hall is lit, apparently by magical means, sufficiently to
allow you to see to the far end, and as far as you can determine it
appears to be a barracks, for humanoid creatures that rest in the
beds that line each side of the hall. Long tables laden with barely
palatable food line the center of the hall, while a seperate table at
the far end serves as mess for the officers of this lot. Lolth seems
to maintain a variety of base and fell creatures as henchmen...

Masters of the Gnolls~
The end of the barracks boasts a table with three large chairs, large
enough to seat a troll or ogre, though the nature of the officers is
something else entirely, though equally in keeping with the vile and
chaotic troops quartered to the east. A half-devoured halfling carcass
has been tossed into one corner, evidently not to the diners' taste.
Halfing meat is notoriously succulent, at least to most carniverous
humanoids.

Sepulchre of the Damned~
The floor of this chamber is of soft earth, in stark contrast to the
stony floor of the fog-shrouded corridors outside. Writhing, whitish
masses crawl through the dark soil, some thrusting suddenly up between
your feet, probing forwards like the groping tentacles of some malign
entity. A narrow, crumbling stone ledge runs around the edge of this
unholy place, harbor of the fell master of this dark domain.

Web of Horrors~
Your vision is clouded by a reddish hue, the blood of the millions of
innocent souls who have been bound into the crimson stone that weaves
through this infernal domain. A tapestry of grim making, a testament
to the evil entity that holds sway over all who pass through her fell
domain. Waves of nausea wash over you sporadically as you search in
desperation for stability in this chaotic maelstrom.

An Irresistable Urge...~
This long corridor is totally devoid of markings or furnishings; the
walls are stark white, as if freshly painted, and the floor is of
smooth white marble. However, a strange tugging sensation that seems
to rapidly gain in intensity distracts you...

A Cluttered Chamber~
This cluttered chamber is strewn with all manner of items, ranging
from furniture to armored corpses, all stuck as if by magic to the
southwestern wall, which hums loudly, much like a field of magical
energy surrounding a spellcaster. It is difficult to move through
the rubble covering the floor, and also difficult to see what else
may be lurking in wait here...

Chamber of Meditation~
This stark white chamber boasts but a single item of interest- a large
carving on the far wall, set with gleaming gemstones, representing the
Queen of Spiders resplendent in her unholy court, doted upon by nude
male suitors of various races, mostly drow but some human and even fair
elven. The entire is suffused with a nimbus of strikingly revolting mauve
energy, which causes nausea on sight to even the staunchest warrior.

Hall of Mirrors~
The entirety of this chamber is peppered with shards of glass, or a 
substance very similar, which catches and reflects your image a
hundredfold, creating a dizzying array of your form. The exact size
of this chamber is therefore understandably difficult to determine,
as everywhere you look you see only a long glass corridor populated
by yourself. However, your attention is drawn to a shifting, spiraling
pattern that advances through the maze of mirrors towards you...

far beyond your range of vision into the inky darkness. It is almost
as if you have exited the web and passed to an aquatic layer of the
Abyss, save that you know in your gut that this anomaly is yet another
of Lolth's creations, a physical manifestation of her twisted muse,
her will alone keeping the waters in check. Dark shapes swim through
the darkness, swimming towards the sudden light you have brought into
their realm...

This candlelit chapel is dominated by a large white altar, before which
one may worship the gods it is dedicated to; evidently the gods of
light and law, surprisingly enough. Wonders never cease- who would be
capable of forging and holding a bastion of law in a layer of the abyss
itself? Perhaps this would be a safe place to regain your strength.

ghoulish artisan, most likely Lolth herself, exercising her will over
the chaotic substance that forms her web. A second door lies at the
far end of this chamber, lit by flickering torchlight, and from this
direction a foul odor indeed rises...

Stepping into this section of the corridor, you are suddenly assaulted
by a series of slashing, whirling blades, that materialize rapidly all
around you. Deep cuts score your armor and flesh, and your blood begins
to flow, pooling on the floor and running along channels in the floor
to the north, from where a low moan rises... This dark chamber is the
only other escape from the slashing blades, other than turning tail and
fleeing like a rabbit...

A spacious chamber, honored by three great thrones of bronze set with
elven skulls and lined with human flesh, opens before you, boasting
numerous other grim trophies, including a series of cadaverous visages,
carved into the floor, where the blood flowing from the south pools,
pouring into their open mouths. With growing horror, you realize that
the visages are the faces of undead beasts, animated by your lifeblood
and rising to take more! The occupants of the thrones cackle and cavort
as they watch the spectacle, preparing to battle you when you are done.

is littered with debris, most of it items you would expect to find in
a charnel house. Scraps of cloth, bits of bone and pieces of flesh
lie scattered in profusion about the dirt, while the clawed hands of
those interred in this foul place protrude at random intervals; it is
with a growing dread in the pit of your stomach that you notice some
of them start to scrabble at the surrounding earth...

there was ever much there that mortal eyes would care to gaze upon. A
sense of loathing fills your heart as you gaze at the pit; you must

Imminent Peril~
The fires of Glabrezu have hurled you yet again further into the web
of the Queen of Spiders; this time, the point of your destination
appears to be an art gallery, of a sort. Lewd and lascivious artwork
covers the walls; expliict scenes of interaction between drow and
demons the most common theme, though monstrous arachnids with elven
upper bodies also feature prominently. Lolth is a mistress of utter
depravity and perversion, in truth, but can she be stopped here, in her
own realm, which so easily molds to her will?

the wood, for the most part not bothering you, yet still making sure
to mark your progress.

Caer Sidi~
A dark forest filled with mildewed, rotting oaks surrounded by thick
clumps of weeds and vines surrounds you, almost suffocating you with
humidity and the strong odor of rotting vegetation. Shapes move about
the wood, for the most part not bothering you, yet still making sure
to mark your progress.

A Guard Tower~
Rising out of the forest is a tower, of dressed grey stone, where the
elves maintain an outpost, and from where they can launch assaults
against these new arrivals to their world. Numerous weapons and pieces
of armor, curiously all of bronze and not steel or mithril, line the
walls, while a narrow stair winds up to the next level.

The Main Chamber~
This chamber appears to have been hastily converted to a council
chamber, where the ruler of this region can plan new campaigns against
the bugbear hordes of Lolth. The elves are hard pressed indeed by the
sheer weight of numbers Lolth is bringing to bear against them, and
are more than willing to ally themselves with any who would seek to do
her harm, as long as they weren't also seeking to do Caer Sidi harm...

Foul Weather~
The door opens onto an ice-filled cavern, which opens to the east onto
a raging blizzard. Even from here, the pure force of the mighty storm
assaults you, chilling you to the bone and blowing you against the far
wall. It would be suicide, not to mention impossible, to try to progress
into that blizzard; apparently this portal opens onto a world that has
already fallen to the taint of Lolth, and all that is left is this winter
wasteland...

A Tiny Purple Island~
This tiny island is the only visible land mass in an endless ocean 
that stretches away on all sides. The waters of this water-covered
world are not as yours, however; this salty brine is pinkish in color,
and flows beneath a yellow sky, lit by a blue sun. The rocky island
is purplish in color, and revolts the eye that is unused to such odd
shades for familiar subjects. Lolth is currently seeking to conquer
this realm, her agents are undoubtedly already here...

Spray from the pinkish waters strikes you in the face as you make your

A Small Island~
This tiny island rises out of the pinkish waters, its rough purplish
volcanic surface a strange sight to one accustomed to blue waters 
washing up on yellow sand. Lotuslike flowers sprout randomly across
the rocky island, save where a section has been cleared to construct
a dock, where a single ship is currently moored; its captain has put
ashore for supplies. Lolth's taint is not strong here; evidently she
has yet to conquer the rulers of this watery world.

The Kingdom of Maldev~
The portal opens onto a rocky mountain pass, that winds northward,
heading past small forts built on the hillsides to the west and then
the east, towards a mighty dwarven fortress that towers above even
the mountains, its gleaming spires under constant assault by the 
hordes of the Queen of Spiders. It would seem there is no end to her
insatiable thirst for conquest. Troops of Lolth can be seen even from
here moving about the pass, and in the vast area before the gates of
the fortress.

At this point a narrow path runs up to the gates of a wooden palisade,
occupied by one of the two sides in this terrible war. Both this and
the other fort you spied are of dwarven make, to be sure, but you can
not tell from here whether dwarves still occupy the structure, or if
it has been taken over by Lolth's hordes.

A pair of wooden gates, bound with bronze, bar entrance to the fort, which
is constructed of treated wood lashed together with rope then reinforced
with wooden crossbeams. A watchtower rises from the interior; doubtless
your arrival has been noticed, unless you took exceptional care. Those who
are quartered within may well treat you with hostility, irrespective of
which side they are on...

The interior of the fort is swathed in darkness, both to foil attempts to

are well used to operating in such a medium. The floors are swept clean,

A Small Office~
This chamber is dominated by a desk littered with battleplans and maps,
while the walls are papered with the same, including a series of missives
from the dwarven king, exhorting his generals to better efforts. Despite
their valor, the dwarves appear doomed to failure; the hordes outnumber
them grossly, and are being reinforced all the time.

Approaching Kandelspire~
The pass continues, winding its way towards the bloodsoaked plains
before the fortress, where the heart of the battle is. Sounds of 
combat ring in your ears, as do the cries of the dying. The dwarves
certainly appear to be dealing significant damage to the hordes, but
they cannot hope to prevail against such punishing odds.

A Wooden Palisade~
At this point a narrow path runs up to the gates of a wooden palisade,
occupied by one of the two sides in this terrible war. Both this and
the other fort you spied are of dwarven make, to be sure, but you can
not tell from here whether dwarves still occupy the structure, or if
it has been taken over by Lolth's hordes.
 
The pass opens onto the decimated valley before Kandelspire to the 
northwest.

The Gates of the Palisade~
A pair of wooden gates, bound with bronze, bar entrance to the fort, which
is constructed of treated wood lashed together with rope then reinforced
with wooden crossbeams. A watchtower rises from the interior; doubtless
your arrival has been noticed, unless you took exceptional care. Those who
are quartered within may well treat you with hostility, irrespective of
which side they are on...

Within the Fort~
The interior of the fort is swathed in darkness, both to foil attempts to
see what forces may lie within, and also because those who occupy the fort
are well used to operating in such a medium. The floors are swept clean,
but show signs of combat in the form of indelible blood stains and deep
gouges in the wood.

A Watch Tower~
This enclosed watchtower affords an excellent view of the pass, as well
as the battlefield before the fortress, which is strewn with bodies and
the hordes of Lolth, wide stretches of the ground seeming to ripple with
the movement of troops.

Quarters of the Demon~
This chamber has been gutted by fire, and boasts only a throne of twisted,
burnt bronze as furnishings, the seat for the general of the armies that
even now rampage across Maldev, laying waste to all they encounter. The
general has waged a very successful campaign thus far, and now all that
remains is to strike the final coup de grace against the beleagured dwarf
fortress of Kandelspire. Thus he spends many hours here, revelling in his
exceptional ability, enjoying the company of slaves when he feels the urge.

The valley before the fortress is a scene of utter horror. Mangled bodies
of dwarf and bugbear alike lie strewn about the rocky ground, as well as
the corpses of humans, bears and ogres. Arrows and rocks rain down from
the sheer walls of the fortress itself, which looms to the north, its tall
spires under aerial assault from dragon and peryton. Dwarves shriek in
dismay as they are blasted from the battlements, while bugbears howl as
they are scattered by falling rocks and darts.

The Gates of Kandelspire~
The massive valves that guard the entrance to this dwarven citadel stand
firm against the hordes, who have parted to allow mighty umber hulks
the chance to smash the gates asunder, or to undermine the mighty walls.
Dwarves plummet from the walls, struck down by boulders or dragonfire,
while the besieged defenders frantically hurl everything they can out the
windows on the invading army below. Despite their valiant efforts, it would
seem they are doomed to fall to the innumerable hordes.

the process of inflicting more losses on the beleagured dwarves. Far below,
reinforcements can be seen flowing in to join the hordes. Bolts and
arrows tear through the sky, fired by dwarves on the battlements, while
large rocks are lobbed by their steam catapults.

trees that have sprouted through the broken, crumbling flagstones. A
pair of bronze double doors lie to the north, at the far end of this
courtyard, while an archway opens onto a shadowy passage to the east.
The whole place reeks of death and decay, smolder and sin.

The door opens onto a sandy desert, albeit one with curiously defined

beyond which you can see the void of outer space. This flat world is
apparently artificial, created (or stolen) by Lolth to house special
"guests" in the bone cage that lies nearby. Some of the bones have fallen
from the cage, and appear to have formed a crude outline of a massive
humanoid...

than the single man who remains, apparently unconcerned by his woeful
predicament.

a troll~
A hideous troll claws its way out of the trash!
~
These trolls are not hill trolls, as are commonly seen in and around
Darkhaven. These rubbery-skinned, black eyed terrors with claws that
can rip steel are dark trolls, used as guards and muscle by most
intelligent subterranean races. To see them here does not bode well.
Lolth has evidently transported them to her realm to serve as guards
and henchmen.

One of Lolth's bugbear soldiers searches the forest for enemies.

Smelly, foul-tempered and cruel, bugbears are eight foot humanoids,
goblinoid in nature and almost ursine in appearance. They are a crude
race used as thugs and guards by other, more intelligent species.
Their presence here in Caer Sidi indicates that Lolth seeks to conquer
this world.

nalfeshnee demon general~
Nalfeshnee~
The demonic general of Lolth's armies on Maldev awaits your arrival.
~
This ancient, rotund demon is visually uninspiring, yet you know well
that he is one of the more powerful demons of the Abyss, and as such
serves Lolth as a general and advisor on campaigns. He is amused more
than worried by your intrusion, and won't even bother attacking you,
unless provoked.

One of Lolth's bugbear soldiers prepares to engage the enemy.

Smelly, foul-tempered and cruel, bugbears are eight foot humanoids,
goblinoid in nature and almost ursine in appearance. They are a crude
race used as thugs and guards by other, more intelligent species.
Their presence here in Caer Sidi indicates that Lolth seeks to conquer
this world.

A hill giant is hurling rocks at the fortress walls.
~
This ugly, knotty-limbed humanoid stands at around nine feet tall, and
is the hue of freshly turned earth. A foul smell, a combination of the
oily hides and the blood of victims that cover their hides, issues from
the creature. A dim malevolent intelligence flickers in its dead brown
eyes, while a cruel grin twists its toothy maw.

Troll shock troops await deployment on the field.

These trolls are not hill trolls, as are commonly seen in and around
Darkhaven. These rubbery-skinned, black eyed terrors with claws that
can rip steel are dark trolls, used as guards and muscle by most
intelligent subterranean races. To see them here does not bode well.
Lolth has evidently transported them to her realm to serve as guards
and henchmen.
