A cold part in the forest.~
As you walk along, the ground and the air start to get cold.  You shiver and
pull your cloak around you, so as to keep warm.  Walking along further, you
are startled to see very fine snowflakes falling softly, noiselessly, to
the ground.  You would stay and watch, but the air is getting so cold that
you feel you must move on.  You can go back the way you came, or go west
into the snow-capped forest.

A frozen conifer forest~
The air is DEFINITELY getting colder... so cold, in fact, that the branches
on the trees are beginning to freeze, and you can feel the ground crack from
the cold underneath you.  You can go further into the forest by going east,
along a small path of dirt which leads west, or back the way you came, 
south.

your way east, but you are thinking about going back west.  All about you
are frozen trees, near-arctic wilflife, and snow.

Too much snow...~
The snowstorm has become too harsh for you to go any further.  You must go
back.  There is a massive heap of snow that has fallen right in front of
you, and it's cold enough to make you pray for a dragon.  You'd better go
west before you die of frostbite.

Along the path.~
You're walking through a light coverlet of snow, just enough to cool a 
hobbit's toes.  It seems like the air is getting a lot colder though, and
as you travel for what seems like ages, the trees' branches are bent
lower and lower with the cold and snow and ice.  Soon, though, you stop
for rest.  The path leads east-west.

Mountaintop Plateau~
You must have gone up more than you thought!  You stand at the edge of the
coniferous forest, laden down with ice, and look along a plateau that runs
along the very top of quite a high mountain.  The mountain is snow-capped,
and you look out from the summit of it towards a massive snowfield that
appears as a dazzling flash of white.  You breathe heavily and sink down
onto a nearby rock to rest - you're in the Polar Circle.  You can go north onto
the summit of the mountain, or you can go east back into the forest.

The summit of Whitefire Mountain~
You stand on the summit of the legendary Whitefire Mountain, and as you
look down onto the snowfields, tales of your childhood, of the horrible
species of creatures that have evolved here, float back to you.  Goats
of the mountains wander about here and there, but not even they look like
easy prey.  There are two paths that lead north and east from here, or you
can go back south towards the forest.

Down the Eastward track~
You are on a track going up and down the mountain in an eastward direction,
and the rocks seem rather loose here.  They don't seem dangerously loose,
and the mountain goats seem to be enjoying themselves.  The track leads
west up the mountain, or down towards a snowfield.

you can see another great snowfield off to the east.  The two seem to be 
separated by a huge snowdrift that seems almost unpassable.  You can go
back south to the mountaintop, or down towards the snowfield.

You're close to the snowfield now, and the goats don't seem to be around...
The snowfield itself stretches like a great expanse of whiteness all around
on the ground.  This is the territory of the fiercely predatory bardelot,
a creature with sabre teeth resembling polar bears, but a lot nastier.

The track you are on is getting rockier and rockier, but much lower.  You
could easily go north to step onto the snowfield from here, and as there don't
seem to be any animals around, it seems like a safe place for sleeping, and
indeed there are signs of previous camps not yet wiped out of the frigid
polar snow.  The only other exit is up.

The Great White Snowfield~
The snowfield lays open to you, bare, white and snowy, and the reflected
sun causes a mean amount of glare.  You have to shade your eyes before you
go on.  The snowfield stretches out quite a way, but is barred to the
north-west by a huge snowdrift that ALMOST looks traversable directly north
of here,barred to the south by a huge glacial wall, and bordered on the 
north-east by an Ice floe, beyond which is the Great Polar Ocean.  You can
go east, north or south - up will take you back up the mountain.

A Small Cave In The Mountainside~
The small cave you're in is, well, small.  Tiny, in fact.  There's not
even much in it, except for the odd bowl made from ice and a few scattered
pieces of fur, presumably scavenged, for bed covers.  They had to be 
scavenged, because the owners of this tiny cave surely couldn't have killed
anything, let alone something with fur.  You can leave east.  Looking 
around, you notice some pictures on a wall.

Up Against The Snow Drift~
You halt in mid-stride - there is a huge snowdrift preventing any further
passage west.  It is far too high to climb, but if you could find a
lower point of it, maybe you could climb over it...  Actually, it seems
to be a little lower to the west of here.  You can go any way bar north,
as the snow drift kind of stops you.

Fishmonger's~
The smell in this room is incredible.  All kinds of seafood are on display,
and for once you know the wares are fresh.  How?  Well, half of it is 
displayed in solid blocks of ice, and you assume the fishmonger hacks it
out of the iceblock for you with that nasty looking ice pick in his
hands.  The door is north.

You stand on the ice floe near the village, and just to the right you see a
large hole cut in the ice, obviously for fishing through.  A discarded rod
lies off to one side - you don't bother getting it.  You think, if you took
a deep breath, you could take a dip and see what's under the ice, but you
REALLY don't think it's a good idea.  It seems to actually be a really BAD
idea, but the option's open.  Otherwise, you can enter the eskimo village

Inside the Ice Cave~
You stand inside a great hollow in the glacial wall, and all about is black
ice.  The room is somehow lit by an odd light, and you for some reason can't
find its source.  There is a door made of the same jet-black ice that the
rest of the cave is made out of to the south - the only other exit from this
place is east.

The Inner Room of Ice~
You have unwittingly walked into a massive room of black ice, lit from above 
by that same, unusual source, and inhabited by a dark, demonic being.  Pots, 
cauldrons and vials of various and often unsavoury description are arranged 
about the walls, and the temperature in this room is incredibly low.  
Presumably the owner likes it that way.  In the centre of the room is a huge 
pentagram, obviously used for magical purposes, and the runes written in the 
outer edge certainly don't say, 'Have a nice day'.

The Plain of Black Ice~
You stand on the very verge of a massive plain of black ice, and to the
east all you see is a dark, cold strip of conifer forest, that blocks your
sight completely.  The air is freezing, and you have trouble breathing
momentarily.

The Verge of a Plain of Black Ice~
You stand at the verge of a plain of black ice, which glints oddly in the
light. Something very fell must have happened here, to stain the ice so...
To the east is a cold strip of conifers, and the air is oddly thin and it
grows noticably colder to the west.
