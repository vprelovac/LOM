The Big, Blue Ocean~
  WHOOSH!  A whirlpool sucks you down and spits you out!
You see the city to the east, with Redferne's castle above,
teeming with all sorts of life.  The ocean is alive!
You wonder about the creatures below.

  The currents are even stronger, as if your boat
has a mind of its own.  The fish bob there heads
up at you, mouthing words half-intelligible.  It seems

Off in the distance you see a high mountain

The Gnome Outpost~
  You see a well-built outpost made of snow
that actually seems cozy with a small fire
in the middle keeping the place warm.  The walls while 
undecorated are clean and well-kempt, though you think 
to yourself "Who'd want to live out here?"
The only exist you see is to the north.

revenge on you now.  The walls are smooth,
with finger holes for you to hang on to.
Down there seems to be flooring to stand on to,
with the passage to return to the surface.

The Center Chamber~
  Before you is the gnome city called Little Haven.
It's bustling, with cheery little folk who seem
dwarven in ancestry and yet look upon you with
a little suspicion.  The tunnels are vast, and from this
vantage point you can see the huge fortress way
in the distance.  You have a long way to go.

as a few you understand: that of the Snow Queen.
