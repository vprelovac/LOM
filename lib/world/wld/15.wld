A Road Leading From The Bank~
   You find yourself on a small road leading away from the edge
of the River of Lost Souls.  The dark waters of the River can
be seen and heard just south of here.  Looking to the east and
west, you see only the walls of the rocky cliffs.  Off to the
north a strange path seems to lead straight into the depths of
the mountain.

A Long Road~
   You stand here in spiritual emptiness, beginning a long and dangerous
path.  Your honest submission has already been made, but the truth of your
heart has yet to be told.  Leave here now, and do not come back until
you have grown.

A Long Road~
   You stop for a moment, screaming in frustration.  Surely it was that one
sin that was avoidable, of all that you regret.  The hitting and the hurting
flash briefly before you.  Moments later the pain passes, and the straight
path reveals itself before you.

A Test for the Faithful~
   It is here finally that decisions must be made.  The first one that
confronts you is simple enough, to walk in the darkness, or to walk in
the light.  Only the depths of your soul can decide, but remember this
much: the same truth lies at the end of both paths.

   Old tales tell of a conversation between the devil and the Prophet
Jesus: the devil offered him a kingdom, vast riches, the temptation of
a glorious near-death saved by his angels.  Even this Messenger of God
was forced to stop and think.  Imagine how hard it could be for the rest.

   He called the populace to strict religious purity, rigidly enforcing
the times of prayer and the most correct forms of the words of the Muezzin.
All of this he strengthened by his most impeccable example, shunning all
riches and riding in tattered rags through his capital on the back of a
donkey.  Despite all this, remember.  Behind closed doors, all men are
hypocrites.

Hate~
   There is little in life much easier, and truthfully, little that is a
quicker ticket to damnation.  You give brief thanks that you have come to
the end of these trials, but your words are drowned out by something
much louder, a mechanical preaching that drowns your ears in anger.  You
hear a steady, repetitive litany of the same phrase, over and over again:
"I go the way history dictates with the blind assurance of a sleep-walker."

at least once in their lives, and there are still some living who curse

let their actions serve as your example.

The Light of the Rashidun~
   Many believed that the Prophet would never die, but when the stark
evidence of his body confronted them, it soon became necessary to provide
for the future.  The four that came after are called the Rashidun, the
rightly-guided Caliphs that would spread the word and the light, and with
it forge one of history's greatest empires.

The Light of the Rashidun~
   The first Caliphs were chosen by consultation with a noble council
of elders, each of whom, hoping to lead the world of Islam alone, voted
to elect the one amongst them they thought was the weakest.  Each time,
they were wrong.  Each one was more noble, more upright than the one
before.

   Every majestic and happy tale must end, usually all too soon, and thus
it was with the golden age of the Caliphate.  The Rashidun were pure men,
good men, true to the path, but their followers soon began to bicker, and
civil war was on the horizon.

   The end of the Rashidun was the beginning of Schism.  The memories
of the Prophet and the living example of the Caliphs proved to be
insufficient example to the faithful.  Ali died, and some say that
with him the Caliphate died too, a martyr, his blood still flowing in
the nameless river.
