old mage reclines against the mirror behind the bar absentmindedly pouring
several drinks at once with his refined telekinesis.  The Lokettes, a local
band, are playing their usual gig on the stage.  The large booths along the
all are filled with people drinking and having a grand time.  You feel like
partying here.

as possible.  In the corner stands a staircase leading down to the

The Sultan's Garden~
   You have entered the Sultan's private gardens.  A light sweat breaks
out on your skin from the humidity here.  All around you are thousands of
exotic plants and flowers.  The sweet smell of jasmine and honeysuckle
reminds you of happier days at home.  Off to the north, through the palm
trees, you see a delicate white gazebo.
   A path leads out into the hallway and west towards the gazebo.
To your right stands a gold sign.

The Art Exhibit~
   You are standing in the Sultan's tribute to the finer virtues.
Large paintings hang from the walls displaying nature scenes, nudes,
and glorious victories in battle.  Strange scupltures rest on pedestals 
at each corner of the room and mirrors are placed in strategic locations
so the viewer may see an entire sculpture at a glance.
   Your eyes, however, are pulled towards a painting that dominates the
far wall.

The Headwaters Of The Dark River~
   A large natural spring issues forth from the heart of the mountain
and flows west down the mountain.  It looks like there was a terrible
earthquake here not too long ago, and a path that leads eastwards
through the mountains is covered with rocks, making passage difficult.

city may provide.  One of these services is the construction crews
the go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order.  Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher then other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.
