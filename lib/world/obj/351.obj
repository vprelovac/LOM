mea $n The letter reads-
mea $n My dear friend Allethandra,
mea $n The Situation is even worse than we predicted. A vile
mea $n beholder, with Illithid help, has ensorcelled the villagers
mea $n of Hochenyana with some sort of ancient artifact, the power
mea $n of which is greatly enhanced by the mental abilities of the
mea $n Illithids. I am not sure who, or what, may be behind these
mea $n creatures; whether they are renegades or agents of a greater
mea $n power is as yet unclear. I would advise we notify the
mea $n Estroglian mage council immediately, and...
mea $n The letter suddenly stops here. Hmm...
else
