sword excalibur~
You run your fingers over the blue green steel of Excalibur, and you feel 
a tingling sensation. Your vison blurs until all you see is a blinding 
white light. A warm sensation fills your limbs, and a sense of relaxed 
comfort permeates you. A deep fatherlike voice says "Now that Arthur is 
dead, it is up to you to right what he wrought. Seek out and destroy Mordred 
and Morgan Le Fey. They are destroying Camelot." The voice and the light 
gradually fade leaving you with only a lingering warm feeling.
