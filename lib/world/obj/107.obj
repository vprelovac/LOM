3rd day of MIssion --
   It is incredible how much corruption is lurking underneath the seamingly
friendly place called 'Murky Land'.  Whoever design such a friendly front
for an illegal tavern frequent by murderers and thieves must be a genius.
I have yet seen what's behind the door next to the tavern.  I'm sure the
rooms there house more than just employees, considering the number of people
going in and out of that door.  In 3 days here, I've seen 8 human-shaped 
bundles hauled through that door already, and nothing coming out.  I need to
get my hands on that skeleton key!

4th day of Mission --
   I wonder if it's my nerves or what, but I keep thinking I am being 
watched and followed.  The shadows in this room seems to be moving, but
I'm sure it's merely the trick of the candlelight.  5 more bundles were
hauled through the employee door today, and I'm sure they are bodies or
victims.

And the God cast down KhXXXX from the Heavens, and spake, "Do not ever

XXXXX XXXXX"  And KXXXXX did die, and as He died, He bled onto the Earth.
But the blood of KhXXXX did not die, for it festered, and every XXXXX XXX,
it will XXX XXXXXX XXXXX XXXXXX, and XXXXX will be rebXXXXX.  He will then
XXXXXX upon the Earth, and he shall name XXXXXXX for his work, and they
