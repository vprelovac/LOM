I created and maintained Lands of Myst between 1996 and 2001. It was the main reason I and many who played it dropped out of the college. But we had the time of our lives!

 	                  STROM'S LOST LANDS

STROM'S LOST LANDS was developed from CircleMUD (3.00bpl8), which was 
developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0).

STROM'S LOST LANDS branched from kosher CircleMUD code by more than 20%.
And thus can be thought of as a derivative of Circle.

STROM'S LOST LANDS was developed by Billy Chan during many lunch breaks
and staying late through the night while working at WindRiver Systems.

I'd like to thank the following people for their help during the development
of STROM'S LOST LANDS:
  
  -- Mike Scheel for the wonderful testing and building.
  -- Clara Ko for understanding and giving me permission to MUD.
  -- Joe Hull and John Wier (theTick and Rimmer) for bug testing and building.
  -- Levork for Iedit and Redit.
  -- Josh Steadman, for some cool areas
  -- Silly MUD for the teleport rooms.
  -- The friends of Strom on Mortal Realms, for giving me the idea of what
     would make a good MUD.
  -- The CircleMUD folks and the DikuMUD folks, for starting the ball rolling.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
	Pink Floyd <floyd@south.mit.edu> for do_scan
	samedi for some of the OLC stuff
Thanks everyone!
